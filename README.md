# Distracted Driver Detection 🚗💥

## Dataset Story 📊
This dataset is focused on identifying and categorizing different types of driver distractions captured in images. It includes images of drivers in various scenarios, such as texting, talking on the phone, adjusting the radio, and more. The primary goal of this dataset is to develop a machine learning model that can detect and classify driver distractions to improve road safety and reduce accident risks.

## Business Problem 💼
The business problem is to create an automated system that identifies distracted driving behaviors from images in real time. By accurately classifying driver behaviors, this system can alert drivers or connected systems, potentially preventing accidents and saving lives. This model has applications in autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and fleet monitoring, helping companies and individuals alike make roads safer. 🌟

## Project Steps 🛠️
Data Preprocessing & Augmentation 📷

Prepare the images by resizing and normalizing them for optimal model input.
Apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations, flips) to enhance model robustness by exposing it to varied data conditions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍

Analyze the distribution of categories (types of distractions) in the dataset.
Visualize sample images to understand the distinct features of each distraction class.

## Feature Extraction 🔧

Leverage transfer learning by using pre-trained models for feature extraction.
Fine-tune the model on the specific classes of distractions to improve accuracy.
Model Building 🤖

Build and evaluate deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify driver distractions.
Experiment with architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Model Evaluation 📈

Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliable classification of each distraction type.
Select the best-performing model for deployment, ensuring robust predictions for real-world applications.

## By following these steps, this project aims to create a highly accurate and efficient system for detecting distracted drivers, contributing to safer driving environments. 🌟💼
